Column descriptions for sample_data_STW and sample_data_NETWORK

sample_id	The unique sample ID assigned to the wastewater sample by EA when orignally recieved by the EA lab
site_code	The site code for the stie from which the sample was collected.
sample_collection_date_time	Date and time that the sample was collected.
Week_date	During data analysis, all samples were assigned to two-weekly bins depending on their sampling date. This column is first date of the two-weekly bin to which the sample was assigned.
ammonia_mg_l	Ammonia concentration in the sample (mg/l)
ophosph_mg_l	Orthophosphate concentration in the sample (mg/l)
GI_ND	TRUE/FALSE - was the Norovirus GI RT-qPCR result a non-detect?
GI_lower_LOQ	TRUE/FALSE - was the Norovirus GI result below the limit of quantification for RT-qPCR ?
GII_ND	TRUE/FALSE - was the Norovirus GII RT-qPCR result a non-detect?
GII_lower_LOQ	TRUE/FALSE - was the Norovirus GII result below the limit of quantification for RT-qPCR?
GI_per_litre	Concentration of norovirus GI (genome copies/l) of the sample as measured prior to normalisation against  flow and population. Non-detects are LOD/2, <LOQ are LOQ/2 applied at the RT-qPCR result stage (i.e. copies/ul are censored before back calculating to copies/l). An NA here means that either there were no GI data availalbe (i.e. no result rather than non-detect)
GII_per_litre	Concentration of norovirus GII (genome copies/l) of the sample as measured prior to normalisation against  flow and population. Non-detects are LOD/2, <LOQ are LOQ/2 applied at the RT-qPCR result stage (i.e. copies/ul are censored before back calculating to copies/l). An NA here means that either there were no GII data availalbe (i.e. no result rather than non-detect)
Log10_GI	Log10 GI_per_litre
Log10_GII	Log10 GII_per_litre
Log10_NoV	Log10(GI_per_litre+GII_per_litre)
Log10_GI_norm	Unit: copies/100k capita. Log10 normalised norovirus GI concentration (GI_per_litre normalised against flow and population). An NA here means that either there were no GI data availalbe (i.e. no result rather than non-detect) or that there was no ammonia or phosphate data for normalisation.
Log10_GII_norm	Unit: copies/100k capita. Log10 normalised norovirus GII concentration (GII_per_litre normalised against flow and population). An NA here means that either there were no GI data availalbe (i.e. no result rather than non-detect) or that there was no ammonia or phosphate data for normalisation.
Log10_NoV_norm	Unit: copies/100 k capita. Log10 normalised norovirus results. This is Log10(10^Log10_GI_norm+10^Log10_GII_norm). - copies/100k capita. An NA here indicates both GI and GII were NA
